Types of Contributions

TA-mailclient could always use more documentation. Feel free to add documentation for an undocumented feature.

5. Submit Feedback

Please rate the app on [Splunkbase](https:://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3200/)
You can also send feedback or submit an issue on [Github](https://github.com/seunomosowon/TA-mailclient/issues).

Feature requests can also be submitted in the same way.
Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

This has been tested with Gmail, gmx.com, and a few other mail servers. You can also send a list of public mail servers that you use this without issues.

Feature requests are yet to be added to Github include the following:
* Oath support for imap
* Additional mailbox folder support for IMAP
* Parameterization of mailbox limits for each run (currenlty set to 25)

I'm also working on integrating with Travis CI to allow automatic tests and continuous integration.

#Guidelines:

Please fork the repo on [Github](https://github.com/seunomosowon/TA-mailclient/) and create a branch for local changes. Create a pull request to the development branch.

Thanks again for volunteering :smiley:
