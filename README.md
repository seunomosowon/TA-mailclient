### OVERVIEW

#### About the TA-mailclient

| Author | Oluwaseun Remi-Omosowon |
| --- | --- |
| App Version | 1.5.5 |
| Vendor Products | <ul><li>poplib</li><li>imaplib</li><li>SDK for Python 1.6.14</li></ul> |

The TA-mailclient add-on fetches emails for Splunk to index from mailboxes
using either POP3 or IMAP, with or without SSL.

The modular input also stores takes the password from inputs.conf in plain text,
and replaces it with a place holder, while storing it encrypted within Splunk.
This is built using the Splunk SDK for Python, should work on any Splunk
installation with Python available including SHC.
Passwords should also get replicated between search heard peer members.

This only fetches emails from the 'inbox' folder when using POP3. Additional mailbox folders can be indexed when using IMAP.

Be sure to set the interval to run this as frequently as required.

It supports all 'text/\*' content types and several well known scripts (.bat, .js, .sh) detailed below:

```
'application/xml'
'application/xhtml'
'application/x-sh'
'application/x-csh',
'application/javascript'
'application/bat'
'application/x-bat'
'application/x-msdos-program'
'application/textedit'
```
Images, videos and executables are not indexed.

##### Scripts and binaries

Includes:
- Splunk SDK for Python (1.6.14)
- Six python 2/3 compatibility (1.15.0)
- mail_lib - supports the calculation of vincenty distances which is used by default
    - constants.py - A number of constants / defaults used throughout the mail_lib module.
    - mail_common.py - Shared functions used to parse emails and attachments
    - exceptions raised by functions used in the mail_lib module.

#### Release notes

##### About this release

Version 1.5.5 of the TA-mailclient is compatible with:

| Splunk Enterprise versions | 8.x, 7.x |
| --- | --- |
| CIM | Not Applicable |
| Platforms | Platform independent |
| Lookup file changes | No lookups included in this app |

This version removes support for unencrypted connections to mailboxes to allow the app pass Splunk Certification. 
The _is_secure_ is no longer required and should be removed from the config.

The administrator is responsible for setting the sourcetype to whatever is desired,
as well as extracting CIM fields for the sourcetype.
This app already includes several extractions for different parts of the message that can be reused.

This app will not work on a universal forwarder,
as it requires Python which comes with an HF or a full Splunk install.

**Note:** Travis CI includes tests for both secure versions of POP3 / IMAP. 

##### New features

TA-mailclient includes the following new features:

- Added support for Python 3
- Added six 1.15.0
- Upgraded Splunk SDK to 1.6.14
- Fix CI/CD tests to work for POP3 on v7.3, fix testing
- Added Fix for working with Zips and docx with python2/python3
- Added support for indexing emails from additional folders when using IMAP

##### To Do

- Add attachment file hash to Splunk
- Add support for doc / ppt / pptx

##### Known issues

This is currently tested against 7.3, 8.0 and the latest version of Splunk Enterprise (v8.1 as at the time of this writing).
Issues can be reported and tracked on Github at this time.


##### Third-party software attributions

This uses the inbuilt poplib and imaplib that comes with Python by default.

Contributions on github are welcome and will be incorporated into the main release.
Current contributors are listed in AUTHORS.md.

## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
### Hardware and software requirements

#### Hardware requirements

TA-mailclient supports the following server platforms in the versions supported by Splunk Enterprise:

- Linux
- Windows

The app was developed to be platform agnostic, but tests are mostly run on Linix.

Please contact the developer with issues running this on Windows. See the Splunk documentation for hardware
requirements for running a heavy forwarder.

#### Software requirements

To function properly, TA-mailclient has no external requirements but needs to be installed on a full Splunk
install which provides python and the required libraries (poplib and imaplib).

#### Splunk Enterprise system requirements

Because this add-on runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the [Splunk Enterprise system requirements](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) apply.

#### Download

Download the TA-mailclient at one of the following locaitons:
- [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3200/#/details)
- [Github](https://github.com/seunomosowon/TA-mailclient)

#### Installation steps

##### Deploy to single server instance

To install and configure this app on your supported standalone platform, do one of the following:

- Install on a standalone Splunk Enterprise install via the GUI. [See Link](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Singleserverinstall)
- Extract the technology add-on to ```$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/``` and restart Splunk

##### Deploy to distributed deployment

**Install to search head** - (Standalone or Search head cluster)

- Deploy the props.conf and transforms.conf from TA-mailclient to the search head. 
If using search head cluster, deploy the props.conf and transforms.conf via a search head deployer.


**Install to indexers**

- No App needs to be installed on indexers

**Install to forwarders**

- Follow the steps to install the TA-mailclient on a heavy forwarder.
More instructions available at the following [URL](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Distributedinstall#Heavy_forwarders)

- Configure an email input by going to the setup page or configuring inputs.conf.

##### Deploy to Splunk Cloud

For Splunk cloud installations, install TA-mailclient on a heavy forwarder that has been configured to forward
events to your Splunk Cloud instance. 
The sourcetype is set by the administrator of the heavy forwarder when configuring the inputs.

You can work with Splunk Support on installing the Support add-on on Splunk Cloud for parsing the mails collected.


#### Configure TA-mailclient

This app adds a mail:// modular input and supports a variety of parameters in inputs.conf.

```
[mail://email_address@domain.com]
interval = 600
mailserver = imap.domain.com
password = mypassword
protocol = IMAP|POP3
disabled = 0
mailbox_cleanup = delete
additional_folder = test,rfc,spam

```

Once the input is read, the password gets replaced and shows as 'encrypted'.
As such, the password for the mailbox must not be set to 'encrypted'.

The input can be edited if the password needs to be updated, and the password stored in a password
storage endpoint would get updated automatically. Passwords are never stored in clear text.

A different sourcetype can be specified for each input, thus making it possible to have different sourcetypes
for every mailbox. Mailbox cleanup is also managed automatically, and emails are deleted once it has been
indexed.

##### Parameters

**mailserver** - This is a mandatory field and should be the hostname or
IP address for the mail server or client access server with support for retrieving emails via POP3 or IMAP

**protocol** - This must be set to either POP3 or IMAP

**password** - Passwords must be set for every account,
or the input will get disabled.

**mailbox_cleanup** = This indicates if every email should be deleted as it is read,
  or delayed until the next interval.
  Setting this to ```readonly``` prevents mails from being deleted.

  The default is ```readonly```. Supported options are:
```delayed|delete|readonly```

**interval** - This should be configured to run as frequent as required
to retreive emails. This modular input retrieves up to 20 emails at each run.
A future release to this input might allow the limit to be configured as a parameter to the modular input.

This modular input supports multiple instances, and each input runs at separate intervals.

**include_headers** -  This determines if email headers should be included.

**additional_folders** - This is an optional parameter containing a comma-separated list of additional folders to be indexed if IMAP is configured for the mailbox.

**drop_attachment** -  This is an optional parameter to determine if email attachment should be discarded.

## USER GUIDE

### Data types

Data is indexed using a sourcetype specified by the administrator when configuring the inputs.
If nothing is specified, events will get indexed with a sourcetype of `mail`. 

### Troubleshooting

Once an email is indexed, it will not be re-indexed except the checkpoint directory is emptied.
This can be achieved by running the following command:
```
splunk clean inputdata mail
```

#### Diagnostic & Debug Logs

Logs can be found by searching Splunk internal logs

```index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd (component=ModularInputs OR component=ExecProcessor) mail.py```


Additional logging can be enabled by turning on debug logging for ExecProcessor and ModInputs.
set the logging level of the ExecProcessor to Debug

/opt/splunk/bin/splunk set log-level ExecProcessor -level DEBUG
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk set log-level ModInputs -level DEBUG

You can find additional ways to enable debug logging on
[here](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Troubleshooting/Enabledebuglogging).
